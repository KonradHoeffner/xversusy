Java text mode down scroller game for 2 players. Made in one evening with <a href="http://simont.de">Simon Tr√ºmpler</a>.

Start with "mvn exec:java". Player 1 has "wasd" controls, Player 2 "ijkl".

Only tested on Linux (apparently, character based console text input is really hard for Java and you need native libraries).
